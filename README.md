Evaluating population viability and efficacy of conservation management using integrated population models

# Abstract
Predicting population responses to environmental conditions or management scenarios is a fundamental challenge for effective conservation. Proper consideration of demographic, environmental, and parameter uncertainties is essential for projecting population trends and optimal conservation strategies. We developed a coupled integrated population model-Bayesian population viability analysis (IPM-BPVA) to assess the (i) impact of demographic rates (survival, fecundity, immigration) on past population dynamics; (ii) population viability 10 years into the future; and (iii) efficacy of possible management strategies for the federally endangered Great Lakes piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Our model synthesizes long-term population survey, nest monitoring, and mark-resighting data, while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. We incorporated the latent abundance of eastern North American merlins (Falco columbarius), a primary predator of adult plovers, as a covariate on adult survival via a parallel state-space model, accounting for the influence of an imperfectly observed process (i.e., predation pressure) on population viability. Mean plover abundance increased from 18 pairs in 1993 to 75 pairs in 2016, but annual population growth ((λ_t ) ̅) was projected to be 0.95 (95% CI: 0.72 – 1.12), suggesting a potential decline to 67 pairs within ten years. Had we not included a merlin effect, we would have erroneously concluded that the population was projected to increase ((λ_t ) ̅ = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94 – 1.09) to 91 pairs by 2026. We compared four conservation scenarios: (1) no proposed management; (2) increased control of chick predators (e.g., Corvidae, Laridae, mammals); (3) increased merlin control; and (4) simultaneous chick predator and merlin control. Compared to the null scenario, chick predator control reduced quasi-extinction probability (≤ 15 pairs remaining) from 11.9% to 8.7%, merlin control more than halved (3.5%) the probability, and combining both control measures reduced quasi-extinction probability to 2.6%. Recovery actions should consider systematic predator control, rather than current ad hoc protocols, especially given that regional merlin abundance is predicted to increase over the next 10 years. Our study is the first to combine IPM with BPVA to identify limiting components of the population cycle and evaluate alternative management strategies for conservation decision-making. This integrative approach shows great utility for aiding recovery of threatened populations.
